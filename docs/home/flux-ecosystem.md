# Flux Ecosystem

The Flux ecosystem is a comprehensive suite of Web3 infrastructure products and services built on decentralized blockchain technology. This documentation focuses primarily on **cloud-centric products** that enable developers and businesses to deploy applications on decentralized infrastructure. For additional Flux products—including wallets, AI tools, and decentralized exchange—see the **More Products** section below.

## What is Flux?

Flux is a decentralized computing network consisting of over **10,000 community-operated nodes** across **66 countries**, providing censorship-resistant cloud infrastructure that rivals traditional providers like AWS and GCP at up to **90% lower cost**. The network is powered by the FLUX cryptocurrency and operates through a Proof-of-Work blockchain that coordinates resources, verifies transactions, and distributes rewards.
