# Overview

**FluxEdge** is a decentralized marketplace for GPU compute resources, connecting users who need computational power with providers offering underutilized hardware. Built on the Flux Web3 infrastructure, FluxEdge provides access to enterprise-grade GPUs at competitive, pay-as-you-go pricing for AI, machine learning, rendering, and other intensive workloads.

## What is FluxEdge?

FluxEdge operates as a global GPU marketplace where **individuals and organizations** can rent high-performance NVIDIA GPUs (including H100, A100, and other enterprise-grade cards) on-demand. Unlike centralized cloud providers, FluxEdge leverages a distributed network of GPU providers, making compute resources more accessible and cost-effective.

The platform is powered by **Proof-of-Useful-Work**, which maximizes GPU utilization by putting idle computing power to productive use. This approach reduces e-waste and ensures efficient resource allocation across the network.
