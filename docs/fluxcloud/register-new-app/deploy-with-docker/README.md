Deploy your own Docker container on FluxCloud's global, distributed network. This guide walks you through launching a custom Docker application step by step.

### Overview of Tabs

You'll configure all necessary settings across these tabs:

* **[General](./general)** - App name, Docker image, and basic settings
* **[Geolocation](./geolocation)** - Geographic deployment preferences
* **[Priority Nodes](./priority-nodes)** - Preferred node selection
* **[Components](./components)** - Resource allocation and ports
* **[Review](./review)** - Final review and deployment

After deployment, you can optionally configure a **[Custom Domain](../custom-domain-setup)**.

### When to Use Docker Deployment

Docker deployment is ideal when:

- You have an existing Docker image ready to deploy
- You need full control over your container configuration
- You're deploying databases, game servers, or custom infrastructure
- Your application requires specific system-level configurations
