# Welcome to Flux

Welcome to the **Flux documentation portal** — your comprehensive resource for building, deploying, and operating on the world's largest decentralized Web3 cloud infrastructure.

Flux is a globally distributed computing network powered by **10,000+ community-operated nodes across 66 countries**, providing censorship-resistant cloud infrastructure at up to **90% lower cost** than traditional providers like AWS or GCP. Whether you're deploying decentralized applications, renting GPUs for AI workloads, running validator nodes, or contributing compute resources to the network, this documentation will guide you through every step.

## Why Flux?

- **Truly Decentralized**: No single point of failure with 560+ independent infrastructure providers globally
- **Cost Effective**: Save up to 90% compared to centralized cloud providers with no egress fees
- **Censorship Resistant**: Deploy applications that can't be taken down or controlled by any single entity
- **Developer Friendly**: Docker-based deployments with familiar APIs and comprehensive tooling
- **Earn While You Contribute**: Run nodes or provide GPU resources and earn FLUX rewards
